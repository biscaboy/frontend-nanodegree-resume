Hello!  

This is my submission for Project 2 of the Front End Nano Degree program.  

I've customized my resume to include a responsive design.   

I also added some simple animation on the project images when you hover over them using DOM manipulation methods in resumeBuilder.js. 

I also modified my map to match the color scheme of the resume in helper.js.

I researched using these sites which were very helpful:
Google Maps API
JQuery Documentation
stackoverflow.com
W3Schools.com
developer.mozilla.com
css-tricks.com

I also used Google Fonts and Font Awesome to customize the look of the resume.

Enjoy.
